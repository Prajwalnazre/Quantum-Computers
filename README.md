# Quantum-Computers
I have done a research project on 'Implementing Machine Learning on a Quantum Environment'.
This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook of the project as well as the paper that I have applied to publish at ICORT-2021.

The QNN (Quantum Neural Network) is being built and compared its performace to that of a CNN (Convoluted Neural Networks)
